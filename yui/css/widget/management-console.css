/**
 * 
    CSS part of a Management Console that provides a liquid three-column layout 
    with a center column having a pair of master-detail panes.
    Works in all modern browsers, and in IE 8 and IE 7.  The aim has been to let the 
    css and html take care of as much as possible, for fast load time and responsiveness.  

    License: 

    By 'source', below, is meant the html page and the associated css (in the css files linked and 
    any in-line) and the non-YUI3 JavaScript used for positioning the columns and 
    master-detail panes of the Management Console.  For further detail on the license, see:
